# wuchale

A non-invasive compile-time internationalization (i18n) system for Svelte ‚Äî
inspired by Lingui, but built from scratch with performance, clarity, and
simplicity in mind.

> üåç Smart translations, tiny runtime, full HMR. `wuchale` extracts your
> strings at build time, generates optimized translation catalogs, supports
> live translations (even from Gemini), and ships almost no extra code to
> production.

## ‚ú® Features

### ü™Ñ Invisible Integration

*Write your Svelte code naturally.* ‚Äî instead of
`<p>{t('Hello')}</p>`, or `<p><Trans>Hello</Trans></p>`, or
`<p>{t(page.home.hello)}</p>`, you write just:

```svelte

<p>Hello</p>

```

No extra imports or annotations. `wuchale` extracts and compiles everything
automatically. In the spirit of Svelte itself.

> They say "i18n is too costly to add later"

‚ú® **Not anymore**. wuchale brings i18n to existing Svelte projects ‚Äî the UX-first way.

### üß† Compiler-Powered

Built on the Svelte compiler and powered by AST
analysis. All transformations happen at build time using Vite. Runtime is
minimal and constant-time.

### üß© Full Nesting Support

Handles deeply nested markup and interpolations ‚Äî mixed conditionals, loops,
and awaits ‚Äî by compiling them into nested Svelte snippets. That means you can
go as crazy as
[this test](https://github.com/K1DV5/wuchale/blob/main/tests/complicated/app.svelte)
and it will still extract the correct texts.

### üì¶ No String Parsing at Runtime

Messages are compiled into arrays with index-based lookups. Runtime only
concatenates and renders ‚Äî no regex, replace, or complex logic. And the
compiled bundles are as small as possible, they don't even have keys.

### üîÅ HMR & Dev Translations Live updates during development.

Translation files and source changes trigger updates instantly ‚Äî including
optional Gemini-based auto-translation. This means you can write the code in
English and have it shown in another language in the browser while in dev mode.

### üî§ Uses .po Files

Output is standard gettext .po files with references, status tracking, and
optional integration with external tools.

### üöÄ Tiny Footprint

Adds just 2 packages (itself and `pofile`) to `node_modules`, as the other
dependency is Svelte itself. No 200 packages and 90MB dependency trees like
some existing solutions.

### ‚ú® Ready for Svelte 5

Works with Svelte 5's new architecture and snippets. Future-proof and tightly
integrated

## üöÄ Getting Started

Install:

```bash
npm install wuchale
```

Add to your Vite config:

```javascript

import { svelte } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte'
import { wuchale } from 'wuchale'

export default {
    plugins: [
        wuchale(),
        svelte(),
    ]
    // ...your other config
}

```

Create `/src/locales/` (relative to the projects root) if it doesn't exist, and
then set it up in your main component:

- SvelteKit: `src/routes/+page.svelte`
- Svelte: `src/App.svelte`

```svelte
<script>
    import {setTranslations} from 'wuchale/runtime.svelte.js'

    let locale = $state('en')

    $effect.pre(() => {
        // IMPORTANT! The path should be relative to the current file (vite restriction).
        import(`../locales/${locale}.json`).then(mod => { // ./locales/${locale}.json for svelte
            setTranslations(mod.default)
        })
        // but this only applies if you want to do lazy loading.
        // Otherwise you can do an absolute import
    })
</script>
```

Note that you manage the state of which locale is active and how to download
the compiled `.json`. This is to allow maximum flexibility, meaning you can use
lazy loading (like this example) or you can import it directly and it will be
bundled by Vite. After that, you notify `wuchale` to set it as the current one.

Then finally you write your Svelte files naturally:

```svelte

<!-- you write -->
<p>Hello</p>

<!-- it becomes -->

<script>
import WuchaleTrans, { wuchaleTrans } from 'wuchale/runtime.svelte'
</script>
<p>{wuchaleTrans(0)}</p> <!-- Extracted "Hello" as index 0 -->
```

Full example below.

## üì¶ How It Works

### Process

![Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/K1DV5/wuchale/main/images/diagram.svg)

1. All text nodes are extracted using AST traversal.
1. Replaced with index-based lookups `wuchaleTrans(n)`, which is minifiable for production builds.
1. Catalog is updated
1. If Gemini integration is enabled, it fetches translations automatically.
1. Messages are compiled and written
1. In dev mode: Vite picks the write and does HMR during dev
1. In production mode: unused messages are marked obsolete
1. On next run, obsolete ones are purged unless reused.
1. Final build contains only minified catalogs and the runtime.

### Catalogs:

- Stored as PO files (.po).
- Compatible with tools like Poedit or translation.io.
- Includes source references and obsolete flags for cleaning.

## üåê Gemini Integration (optional)

To enable the Gemini live translation, set the environment variable
`GEMINI_API_KEY` to your API key beforehand. The integration is:

- Rate-limit friendly (bundles messages to be translated into one request)
- Only translates new/changed messages
- Keeps original source intact

## üß™ Example

Input:

```svelte

<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>Hello <b>{userName}</b></p>

```

Output:

```svelte
<script>
import WuchaleTrans, { wuchaleTrans } from 'wuchale/runtime.svelte'
</script>

<p>{wuchaleTrans(0)}</p>

<p>
  {#snippet wuchaleSnippet0(ctx)}
      <b>{ctx[1]}</b>
  {/snippet}
  <WuchaleTrans tags={[wuchaleSnippet0]} id={1} args={[userName]} />
</p>

```

Extracted catalog (PO) for `en`:

```nginx

msgid "Hi there!"
msgstr "Hi there!"

msgid "Hello {0}"
msgstr "Hello {0}"

```

Extracted catalog (PO) for `es`, initially empty `msgstr`, but after a translator or Gemini translates it:

```nginx

msgid "Hi there!"
msgstr "¬°Hola!"

msgid "Hello {0}"
msgstr "Hola {0}"

```

Which is then automatically compiled to:

```json
[
    "¬°Hola!",
    [
        "Hola ",
        [
            0,
            0
        ]
    ]
]
```

This is what you import when you set it up above in `App.svelte`.

## Supported syntax

Text can be in three places and the probability of the text inside them being
intended is different for each of them. Therefore, a global heuristic function
is applied to check whether the text should be extracted depending on each
case, discussed below. And for specific granular control, comments can be used,
like for typescript: `@wc-ignore` and `@wc-include`.

### Markup

Markup means text that we write inside tags like in paragraphs. This is almost
always intended to be shown to the user. Therefore, the default global rule is
to extract all text inside the markup, with the ability to force ignore with a
comment:

```svelte
<p>This is extracted</p>
<!-- @wc-ignore -->
<p>This is ignored</p>
```

### Attributes

Attributes are the text that are literally written like `class="this"`. Dynamic
attributes are not considered for this rule, instead they follow the script
rule below, because they are JS expressions. For text attributes, the default
rule is that all text starting with a capital letter is extracted.
Example:

```svelte
<p class="not-extracted" title="Extracted">
    This is extracted
</p>
```

For ignoring or force-including, convert them to expressions and follow the
script rule below.

### Script

This includes all JS/TS code that is:

- Inside `<script>` tags
- Inside dynamic expressions inside the markup or attributes, anything in curly braces like `{call('this guy')}`
- In `*.svelte.[js|ts]` files.

The rule for this is that all strings and template strings that start with
capital letters are extracted. Additionally, if they are used inside the
`<script>` tags and in their own files (third case above), there is the
additional restriction that they must be inside a `$derived` or `$derived.by`
variable declaration. This is to make the behavior less magic and being more
explicit. Example:

```svelte
<script>
    const a = 'Not extracted'
    const b = $derived('not extracted either')
    const c = $derived('This one is extracted')
    const d = $derived(`This one as well ${a} - ${b}`)
    const d = $derived(/* @wc-include */ `${a} - ${b} this is force extracted`)
</script>

<p class={/* @wc-ignore */ `Ignore${3}`} title={'Included'} >Normal text</p>

```

## Context?

Sometimes we need to have different translations that are the same text in the
source language. For that, the comment directive `@wc-context:` is provided and
they will be separate.

```svelte
<b>
    <!-- @wc-context: machine -->
    Maintenance
</b>
<i>Is different from</i>
<b>
    <!-- @wc-context: beauty -->
    Maintenance
</b>
```

Excuse my poor example choice.

## Plurals?

Since messages can be written anywhere in the reactive places, it was not
necessary to have a separate plurals support because you can do something like:

```svelte

<p>{items === 1 ? 'One item listed' : `${items} items listed`}

```

And they will be extracted separately. You can also make a reusable function
yourself.

## Configuration

To configure `wuchale`, you pass an object that looks like the following (the
default) to `wuchale()` in your `vite.config.js` `vite.config.ts`:

```javascript
export const defaultOptions: Options = {
    sourceLocale: 'en',
    otherLocales: [],
    localesDir: './src/locales',
    heuristic: defaultHeuristic,
    geminiAPIKey: 'env',
}
```

While the others are self explanatory, the `heuristic` is a function that
globally decides what text to extract and what not to. The `defaultHeuristic`
is the implementation of the above rules, but you can roll your own and provide
it here. The function should receive the following arguments:

- `text`: The candidate text
- `scope`: Where the text is located, i.e. it can be one of `markup`, `script`, and `attribute`

And it should return boolean to indicate whether to extract it.

## Files management

`wuchale` generates two files for each locale.

### `.po` file

This is a `gettext` file that is used to exchange the text fragments with translators. The workflow is:

- You give them the file with empty places for the translated fragments
- They fill it with the translation, preserving the placeholders, but they can change the orders as the language requires.
- You get the file back and make it part of your codebase.

**Note**: You should commit these files, they are where the translated
fragments are stored and are the source of truth for the translations.

### Compiled `.json` file

This is the compiled version of the `.po` file. It is generated at the startup
of the dev server and at build time. As it has to be generated every time, you
should consider it as a temp file and therefore you should **not** commit it.

## üßπ Cleaning

Unused keys are marked as obsolete during a production build. Obsoletes are
purged on the next run (build or dev). Essentially this means cleaning needs
two passes. This is because of how vite/rollup works.

## üß™ Tests

A wide range of scenarios are tested, including:

- Raw strings, HTML markup, nested blocks
- Loops, awaits, conditionals
- PO parsing and index consistency
- Obsolete tracking and cleanup
